This project is a single file Hello World Dagger-2 Java 8 Maven
project.  The idea was to demonstrate the minimal amount of work
needed.

Tested with Intellij 2017 (File -> Open), Eclipse 4.6.3 (File->
Import... -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects ; Eclipse _must_ have
annotation processing enabled - see below) and Netbeans 8.2 on Ubuntu
17.04.

If the Dagger classes are not automatically generated by the IDE when
opened (happens with older versions of IntelliJ and Eclipse without
m2e-apt enabled), run

    mvn clean package

To run from the command line:

    mvn -q exec:java

Note: Eclipse requires enabling annotation processor support installed
and enabled!  The m2e-apt plugin can be downloaded from the Eclipse
Marketplace or https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/m2e-apt (which
also has configuration instructions).  Ensure that Preferences ->
Maven -> Annotation Processing is set to "Automatically configure JDT
APT" or this will not work.
